# breakdownExport..
A proposal for a standardized format for exporting [script breakdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_breakdown) in the entertainment industry.

Two standards are necessary to facilitate this goal:

1) Standard for naming and identifying category types.
2) Standard format for exporting a full breakdown of a script that includes categories, elements and breakdown sheets.

See the files in the [/samples](https://github.com/thinkcrew/breakdownExport/tree/master/samples) folder for examples.
