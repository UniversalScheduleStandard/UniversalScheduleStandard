# breakdownExport
A proposal for a standardized format for exporting script breakdowns in the entertainment industry.

Two standards are necessary to facilitate this goal:

1) Standard for naming and identifying category types.
2) Standard format for exporting a full breakdown of a script that includes categories, elements and breakdown sheets.

See the files in teh /samples folder for examples.
